CSE 163 Final Project
Jessica Robinson, Sally (Sarah) Schafer, Vianne Bui Nguyen

## Modules & instructions to run

- `main.py`: run this module to load the three datasets, compute and print summary statistics, and generate the plots
using the functions defined in the `analysis.py` module. If running in Visual Studio, plots will appear in the file tree on the left-hand side of the editor. For .png files, click the file to open the plot in Visual Studio. For .html files (used for the `plotly` visualizations), download the file and open it in File Explorer/Finder to view the plot or open and run the file in Visual Studio to view the plot in your browser.

- `analysis.py`: contains all the functions that generate the plots that answer
our research questions.  These functions are called by the `main.py` module.

- `test.py`: contains functions that test the data filtering in
`analysis.py` by using print statements. All these tests are called in the
`main` method in the same module. Simply run the `test.py` module to view the
results of the test functions.

## Libraries used
